<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm glad you're here to learn about me.  I'm a self-taught Web Developer looking for new opportunties in the industry.</p>

<p>My background in the tech industry has mostly been based around MS SQL Server.  I've worked over 15 years with a company building and maintaining data solutions.  
  My skills include, but not limited to:  Transact-SQL, MS Excel, VBA, JavaScript, Python, and many others! 
</p>

<p>Outside of my career - I am a very outgoing person that enjoys spending time with family and friends.  Whether that's on a 3 day camping trip or losing golf balls.  I try to take
  every opportunity to be outside and enjoy the great outdoors.
